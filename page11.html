            <p>
                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, a gas giant known for its unique tilt, rotating almost on its side. It is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a pale blue color. Uranus has a diameter of about 50,724 kilometers and takes 84 Earth years to complete an orbit around the Sun. Its extreme axial tilt causes unusual seasonal variations.            </p>

                      <li>Uranus takes approximately 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.</li>
                      <li>The planet's orbit is nearly circular, with a slight elliptical shape.</li>
                      <li>Uranus is located about 2.9 billion kilometers from the Sun.</li>
                      <li>It has an axial tilt of 98 degrees, making it rotate almost on its side.</li>
                      <li>Each rotation of Uranus takes about 17.2 Earth hours.</li>
                      <li>The extreme tilt causes unusual seasonal patterns, with long days and nights at the poles.</li>

                    <h4>Exploration of Uranus</h4>
                    <p>Uranus has been explored only by a few spacecraft, mainly through distant observations and flybys.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Voyager 2, launched by NASA, is the only spacecraft to have visited Uranus, passing by in 1986.</li>
                        <li>Voyager 2's flyby provided valuable data about the planet's atmosphere, rings, and moons.</li>
                        <li>Since then, Uranus has been studied remotely by telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
                        <li>Scientists continue to propose future missions, but there have been no confirmed plans for another dedicated mission to Uranus.</li>
