            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. It is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, giving it a deep blue color. Neptune has a diameter of about 49,244 kilometers and takes around 165 Earth years to complete an orbit. Known for its strong winds and storm systems, Neptune is a dynamic planet with a faint, icy ring system. Its distance from Earth and thick atmosphere make it a challenging target for exploration.</p>
