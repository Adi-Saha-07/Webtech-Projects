            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and stands out as a giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. It is a gas giant, lacking a solid surface, with a composition and structure that resemble a small star. Its immense size and mass significantly influence the solar system's gravitational dynamics. The planet's most distinguishing feature is the Great Red Spot, a colossal storm that has been raging for centuries, larger than the size of Earth. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, which is the most powerful among all planets in our solar system, and it also possesses dozens of moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons are unique worlds in their own right, with features such as active volcanism, potential subsurface oceans, and varying geological histories. Jupiter's rapid rotation results in a bulging equator and flattened poles, along with vibrant bands of clouds and storms in its atmosphere. Its exploration has been the focus of numerous space missions, providing valuable insights into the planet’s structure, atmosphere, and its intriguing system of rings and moons. Jupiter remains an essential object of study for understanding the formation and evolution of planetary systems.</p>
