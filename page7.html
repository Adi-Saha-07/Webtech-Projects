            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>Earth, our home planet, is a dynamic and vibrant celestial body teeming with life. Positioned as the third planet from the Sun, it resides within the habitable zone, allowing liquid water to exist—a critical element for sustaining life. Earth is unique in its composition, featuring vast oceans that cover about 71% of its surface, interspersed with diverse landforms like mountains, valleys, plains, and deserts. Its atmosphere, a delicate blend of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace gases, not only supports life but also shields the planet from harmful solar radiation.<br>

                The planet’s interior is equally fascinating, comprising a core of molten iron and nickel, a viscous mantle, and a solid crust that supports tectonic activity. These processes give rise to earthquakes, volcanoes, and the formation of mountain ranges. Earth's rotation and axial tilt contribute to the alternation of day and night and the variation of seasons, creating a rich tapestry of climates and ecosystems.<br>
                
                Life on Earth is remarkably diverse, ranging from microscopic organisms to complex multicellular beings, all intricately connected within ecosystems. Over billions of years, the planet has evolved, shaped by natural forces and human activity, making it a continuously changing and awe-inspiring place in the vast cosmos.</p>

            <p>The atmosphere of Earth is a layer of gases surrounding the planet, essential for supporting life. It acts as a protective shield against harmful solar radiation, helps regulate the Earth's temperature, and provides the oxygen necessary for living beings. The atmosphere is composed of multiple layers, each with distinct characteristics and functions.

            <h2>4. Climate</h2>
            <p>The climate of Earth is a complex and dynamic system influenced by various natural and human factors. It encompasses long-term patterns of temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions in a specific region or globally. Here’s a breakdown of the Earth's climate system.
                <article class="star-type">
                    <h4>Climate Zones </h4>
                    Earth's climate varies across different regions, primarily due to the uneven distribution of sunlight caused by its spherical shape and axial tilt. Broadly, the climate can be categorized into.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tropical: Found near the equator, characterized by high temperatures and significant rainfall year-round. Examples include rainforests like the Amazon.</li>
                        <li>Dry: Includes deserts and arid regions with minimal rainfall, such as the Sahara Desert.</li>
                        <li>Temperate: Moderate climates with distinct seasons, found in regions like Europe and parts of North America.</li>
                        <li>Polar: Extremely cold climates near the poles, such as Antarctica and the Arctic.</li>
                        <li>Continental: Found in inland regions, experiencing extreme temperatures in summer and winter</li>
