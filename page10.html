            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system, known for its stunning system of rings. It is a gas giant composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a dense core of rock and metal at its center. The planet is remarkable for its pale yellow hue, caused by ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere, and for the intricate, icy rings that encircle it, which are made up of countless particles ranging in size from tiny grains to large chunks. Saturn has a strong magnetic field and numerous moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system, which has a dense atmosphere and surface lakes of liquid methane and ethane. The planet's rapid rotation results in an oblate shape, with a noticeable flattening at the poles. Saturn has been a subject of fascination for astronomers and space missions, such as the Cassini spacecraft, which provided unprecedented insights into the planet, its rings, and its moons.
